# Algorithms and Data Structure Implemented in C++

## Data Structures
Data Structure | Info | File
--- | --- | ---
Binary Tree | tree structure, each node has < 2 children | algorithms/binary_search_tree.cpp
Heaps | Max Heap, Min Heap, allows extracting max/min element efficiently | algorithms/max_heap_sort.cpp

## General Algorithms

Algorithm | Complexity (avg)  | File
--- | --- | ---
Insertion sort | n^2 | algorithms/insertion_sort.cpp
Binary Insertion sort | nlogn | algorithms/binary_insertion_sort.cpp
Merge sort | nlogn | algorithms/merge_sort.cpp
Heap sort  | nlogn | algorithms/max_heap_sort.cpp
Binary Search Tree (BST) sort  | nlogn | algorithms/binary_search_tree.cpp

**note** : *different algorithms have different cases/scenarios where they perform exceptionally better than others.*

## Dynamic Programming Techniques

Technique | Traditional | DPed | Note
---	| --- | --- | --
Memoization | 5383971 ticks | 105 ticks | eg: on fibonacci number generation 43
