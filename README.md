# Algorithms and Data Structure Implemented in C++

## Algorithms

### Sorting
algo | complexity (avg) 
--- | --- 
insertion | n^2 
binary insertions | nlogn 
merge | nlogn 
heap  | nlogn 
bst  | nlogn 

*To-do*
* [ ] Quicksort
* [ ] Shellsort
* [ ] Introsort
* [ ] Selection sort
* [ ] Bubble sort
* [ ] Oddâ€“even sort
* [ ] Cocktail shaker sort
* [ ] Cycle sort
* [ ] Merge-insertion sort
* [ ] Smoothsort
* [ ] Timsort

**note** : *different algorithms have different cases/scenarios where they perform exceptionally better than others.*

## Dynamic Programming Techniques

technique | traditional | dped | note
---	| --- | --- | --
memoization | 5.5 sec | 0.00015 sec | on fibonacci
