# Algorithms and Data Structure Implemented in C++

## General Algorithms

Algorithm | Complexity (avg) 
--- | --- 
Insertion sort | n^2 
Binary Insertion | nlogn 
Merge sort | nlogn 
Heap sort  | nlogn 
Binary Search Tree (BST) sort  | nlogn 

**note** : *different algorithms have different cases/scenarios where they perform exceptionally better than others.*

## Dynamic Programming Techniques

technique | traditional | dped | note
